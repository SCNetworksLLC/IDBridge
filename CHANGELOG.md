# Changelog

All notable changes to IDBridge are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/). Versions use
a calendar scheme `YY.M.D.build` (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning--releases)).

## [Unreleased]

## [26.6.22.0] - 2026-06-22

### Added
- Reference documentation: `CLAUDE.md` and `docs/` (architecture, functions, configuration,
  plugins, secrets).
- Repo standards: `README.md`, `LICENSE` (MIT), `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `.gitignore`.
- `Get-IDBridgeSecret` — resolves a named secret from a SecretManagement vault, falling back
  to the per-user `*.txt` file store (no behavior change for existing deployments).
- Module manifest metadata: `CompanyName`, `Copyright`, and `PrivateData.PSData`
  (Tags, ProjectUri, LicenseUri, ReleaseNotes).

### Changed
- Restructured the repo so the module lives under `src/IDBridge/`, keeping repo-only files
  (docs, `CLAUDE.md`, README) out of the published package.
- Documented the versioning & release process.

### Fixed
- Corrected misleading log messages: `Get-TargetDataAD` no longer logs "Google", and the
  Google group-refresh trace no longer says "AD".

## [26.6.21.0]

- Baseline release: source ingestion (GSheet / Skyward SMS / Infinite Campus), AD and Google
  Workspace provisioning (create / update / deactivate / OU / group sync), plugin system,
  logging to file and Google Sheet.
